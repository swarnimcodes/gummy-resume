    \item As part of the R\&D team, my role was to transform lofty, ambitious and vague
    business ideas and transform them into tangible solutions and turn them into reality.
    Apart from that I also intensively worked in building crafty automation solutions
    mainly for the administration and management of Microsoft SQL Server and Azure Cloud Storage.
    My role also encompassed building internal tools that ease the development processes in the
    organisation.
    Due to my passion and knowledge of linux, i also guided the system administrators in the
    organisation to solve critical linux issues that risked hours of system downtime and loss
    of data and code.
    Due to my passion and curiosity of programming languages, my role also encompassed
    researching about technologies that aren't utilised in the organisation.
    Because of this, I was able to learn and develop an intuitive and feature-rich installation wizards
    for windows applications in an esoteric and then unknown language to me i.e. Pascal.
    Due to my adaptability, vision, and grasping power, i was also able to co-design scalable and robust
    system infrastructure for high-frequency high-traffic products from the ground up with the head of
    r&d in an exclusive team of 3.

---------------

- As a part of the R\&D Department, I transformed ambitious buiness ideas
into clear and actionable solutions, forming a bridge between vision and reality.
- Co-designed robust and scalable system infrastructure for high-frequency,
high-traffic products from the ground up, collaborating with the Head of R\&D
in an exclusive three-person team.
- Demonstrated adaptability by picking up new programming languages and
skills required to drive the objective at hand to completion. For instance, independently
acquired the skill to program in Pascal to build user-friendly and intuitive
Windows installation wizards.
- Relied on my passion and knowledge of linux to guide system administrators in
resolving critical issues, preventing potential data loss and system downtime.
- Built efficient automation solutions and internal tools to streamline 
certain administrative and management tasks for the Microsoft SQL Server
and Azure Cloud Storage.
- Developed internal toolchain and automation applications, increasing
developer efficiency and minimising errors
- Developed internal toolchain for automating database management tasks,
improving system reliabilty and data integrity
- Leveraged frameworks such as Flask and FastAPI to develop backend systems,
keeping fault-tolerance, scalabilty and efficiency as the forefreont focus.
- Designed and implemented fault-tolerant and scalable backend 
systems using Flask and FastAPI, while simultaneously researching about
more modern and robust and efficient and better error handling backend
technologies to develop backend systems in such as Go

- Built robust and scalable backend systems with Flask and FastAPI while
researching modern backend technologies such as Go for future improvements.


Built robust and scalable backend systems using FastAPI, 
leveraging its asynchronous and typing capabilities for high performance and robustness.


- Built resilient and scalable backend systems using FastAPI, 
leveraging its asynchronous and static-typing capabilities for high 
performance and robustness, while researching modern backend technologies
 such as Go for future improvements.

- Built scalable backend systems with FastAPI, utilising its 
asynchronous and static-typing features to achieve optimal performance and reliability.
Researched into emerging backend technologies like Go to drive future enhancements.
